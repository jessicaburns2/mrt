  WTF! Why can I see my friends opponents Elixer bar!? This could break the game again. Clash Royale servers are too secured to be hacked in. Therefore, it is not possible for someone to cheat. (E.g. too much elixir but you can watch the replay).  › global › tournaments › rules.
  
  People are using the spectate "exploit" as an excuse for their losses. I'm saying this because my friend watches me during live games a lot, and whenever I win, the other person goes "wow" probably thinking I'm on another account. The problem with this is now whenever you see one spectator, everybody jumps to the conclusion that they're.  · Clash Royale [Free] is definitely an eSports material but surely needs some modifications to make it so. Supercell is heading towards this path and has announced that with the next update, it will get a live friendly match viewing (spectator mode). With spectator mode, tournaments can become a possibility since the moderator can watch two. These cheaters would use another device to see their opponent's elixir. It is so frustrating to play against someone and seeing the "eye", thinking "oh they're probably cheat". This shouldn't be a difficult fix, redditors are say to remove the elixir bar, or delay the game by a few seconds. Please apply the same to tournament spectate as well.
