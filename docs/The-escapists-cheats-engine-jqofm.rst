If it finds that value, it'll let you alter it, which means you can find where Fatigue is located in memory and alter it directly, which'll change your Fatigue ingame.  · How to use this cheat table? Install Cheat Engine; Double-click  file in order to open it. Click the PC icon in Cheat Engine in order to select the game process. Keep the list.
